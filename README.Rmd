This package automates the process of preparing and loading 
the OMOP Vocabulary Tables into a Postges database.  

## Installation

You can install the development version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("meerapatelmd/setupAthena")
```  

# Requirements   

1. Unpacked vocabulary bundle from 
[athena.ohdsi.org](https://athena.ohdsi.org/). If CPT4 is 
in the bundle, remember to reconstitute it with either the 
`prepare_cpt4` function available in this package or from 
the Command Line using the README.txt that came with the 
vocabularies.   
1. Postgres database with superuser credentials or as a 
member of the pg_read_server_files role. This is necessary 
to run the sql command `COPY` that loads the csvs into the 
tables.  


# Execution  
 
A. After the zip file is unpacked and the CPT4 have been reconstituted:   

```
library(setupAthena) 
run_setup(conn = conn, 
          target_schema = "my_schema",
          path_to_csvs = "~/Desktop/athena_vocab")
```  

B. To use the option of reconstituting CPT4 alongside the rest of the setup:  

```
library(setupAthena) 
run_setup(conn = conn, 
          target_schema = "my_schema",
          path_to_csvs = "~/Desktop/athena_vocab",
          steps = c("prepare_cpt4", "drop_tables", "copy", "indices", "constraints", "log"),
          umls_api_key = 1000-9342-31304)
```
