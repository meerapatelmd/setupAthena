# setupAthena 0.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.  
* Added `log` feature that logs updates with row counts for each table to a `setup_athena_log` table in the `public` schema.  
* Added a `steps` feature to `run_setup` to be able to customize the steps taken for each setup, but not the order.
